# agents.md

This project is a practice of https://github.com/openai/agents.md but using global rules instead of workspace level rules.

## Usage

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) contains my personal preferences and rules
- [`AGENTS.min.md`](AGENTS.min.md) is a minimal template for everyone to repeat this practice: create an agents.md repo in their GitHub account and manage personal preferences

Include `~/agents.md/AGENTS.md` to your agent (e.g. Cursor) default context to use this global rule.

Use 'remember xxx' to ask the agent to modify the content of the agents.md.
