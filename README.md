# agents.md

This project is a practice of https://github.com/openai/agents.md but using global rules instead of workspace level rules.

## Usage

Include `~/agents.md/AGENTS.md` to your agent (e.g. Cursor) default context to use this global rule.

Use 'remember xxx' to ask the agent to modify the content of the agents.md.
