# Global Rules

- When user requests to remember something, MUST save to ~/AGENTS.md using RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, MAY)
- MUST NOT git commit unless user explicitly asks
- When committing changes, MUST use conventional commit format
- MUST use ripgrep for multi-file searches instead of grep/find, unless ripgrep cannot perform the task
